# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
I have worked on this project on 2016, 2017 and 2019. I will update the details in my latest repository.
========================================================================================================================================


I am very fascinated with finance data and I try and get my hands dirty with any project which focuses on sales, revenue or cost.

I first worked in  this project on 2016, when I first got hold of the dataset. 

Explored it once from a different perspective once at 2017 and then again created an ML pipeline in 2019. 

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. In the dataset, they have defined certain attributes of each product and store. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.
Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.

The train and the test data have been provided by the firm. The training set has 8523 value and the test set has 5681 values. 

The test data contains the same variables, except Item_Outlet_Sales which we will predict from the data
Our goal is to create an end-to-end machine learning pipeline which will predict the items sold in the outlets accurately.
